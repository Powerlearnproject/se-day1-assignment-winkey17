Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is an application that systematically applies principles, methods and tools used in developing and maintaining high quality software products. It is applied in modern life areas such as entertainment, communication, health care and commerce.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of Digital computers which was discovered in 1950s  
Development of Complex Software Systems which was used in developing structured methodologies
Development of Programming Languages such as Fortran used in developing Operating Systems

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: acquiring the users needs through documentation and gathering.
Design: creating high level designs according to the software architecture.
Implementation: writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: ensuring the software meets the standard quality and functional requirements.
Deployment: releasing the software to the consumers or users.
Maintenance: doing support and updates on the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile methodology is flexible and adapatable to change, it also promotes collaboration while Waterfall methodology is based on project progression with a fixed goal hence making it inflexible.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: To write code and implement Software Solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer: To design Software quality through executing test plans.
Project Manager: Planning execution and delivering software system architecture.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: it is a tool to write, debug and test code such as VS Code
VCS: it is a tool to manage changes on code such as Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Mpst software engineers face delay and time constraints during software implementation and limited infrastructure,time and resources. Such issues can be resolved by Modularity where the software project can be subdivided into modules making it easy to implement, test and understand. To resolve on time, the project should be managed in a way its set to meet deadlines and allocate resources effectively.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: it is the testing of individual modules of the software.
Integration testing: testing between different interactions of modules.
System testing: testing the entire system.
Acceptance testing:testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering : is it coming up with the right questions or statements to get the best response from AI models. It improves interaction between humans and AI.
It makes one to understand the AI model by adding context.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about cooking githeri. 
Explain a step by step method of cooking githeri.
The improved prompt is more effective because it is short, precise and it gives the right prompt so that the AI tool can give the correct response.
